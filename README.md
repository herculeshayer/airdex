1. On occasion the city will not have the information needed for display. Specifically, this causes the 
application to crash due to undefined data.
2. The Chart.js bar graph is not entirely responsive. Further inspection needed
3. Added react-router to navigate to a 404 page, however it's recently been updated to v6 and 
it would additional time to navigate a solution

## TODO - Addons
1. Test API using Jest. Integration testing for reliable API calls
2. CI/CD GitHub Actions testing
